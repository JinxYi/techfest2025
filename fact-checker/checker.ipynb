From what I remember reading, it was in November 2020. Specifically, after President-elect Joe Biden won the electoral college but lost the popular vote. So maybe around January or February 2021? I think that\\'s right.\\n\\nI recall seeing various clips of Trump talking about rigging. He was pretty intense when he made these claims, sometimes blaming election officials and even mentioning \"fellow citizens.\" Now, to verify this claim, I need reliable sources. So I should check the official White House transcript or transcripts from CNN or another reputable news network since they usually tape their QUESTIOMS AND Answers.\\n\\nWait, actually, Trump didn\\'t have a daily press conference in 2021 after becoming president because he left the presidency in July without completing开车 an oath of office. So maybe I can check a transcript of one of his speeches around that time where he made the claim. The New York Times or another outlet might have it recorded.\\n\\nI should also look into any reports from reputable organizations like the NIST.gov or the demi website, which track election integrity. They probably mentioned Trump\\'s claim after the 2020 election.\\n\\nLooking at current sources now in 2023, I can checkFactCheck.org or Snopes to see if they\\'ve re-evaluated this claim as false since there have been many recountings and audits of the electoral votes. As of my last update, most sources consider Trump\\'s claims as fact-checked as false.\\n\\nPutting that together, the credibility score should be low because multiple independent checks show his statement was without factual basis.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe claim that Donald Trump made during the 2020 election stating \"the election was rigged\" is fact-checked by reliable sources and found to be without merit.
